#Problem Space
a problem space is the theoretical _given_ area of all possible problems within a given context.

- Example 1
  - The cost of living in Auckland for working families could be the context.
    - The specific problem space could be  the percentage cost of rent for working families who cannot navigate their current government agency entitlements 
  due to time constraints, language barriers, or lack of access to the internet could be the problem space.

How we seek to address these problems is the _solution_ space. 

- Example 2
  - The difficulty in learning to code for career switchers in New Zealand could be the context. 
    - The specific problem space could be the difficulty in learning to code for people who are not able to attend a coding bootcamp due to time constraints, language barriers, or lack of access to the internet could be the problem space.
