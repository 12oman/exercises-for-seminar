# scenario 1: No Exit
Imagine that you can never sell your business and you can never retire. What changes would you make in your business as a result? What changes would you make in your life?

# scenario 2: No Employees
Imagine the business is just you without any full-time employees (FTEs). If you need team members you have to employ the Hollywood studio model in which you bring contractors together for a project and then disband.

Considering your current business model. What people and or roles would you keep? What other changes would you need to make? If the people are somewhat interchangeable, what remains that makes you distinct?

# scenario 3: No Pitch
You cannot pitch (give any idea or advice away for free) anything to win business. How do you get new clients? What tools or approaches do you use instead? Let’s keep this post-Covid relevant and add in the travel constraint: you also cannot meet with the prospective client face to face.

# scenario 4: No Service (only products)

Imagine that instead of fee-for-service work, your clients instead must buy a product or productized service from you. No customization is allowed, and no intellectual property (IP) can ever transfer. What product (digital or physical) or productized service do you create? How do you achieve the added scale you need to support this model? What are the other implications on your business?

# scenario 5: No Model
You must aim to 10X YOUR BUSINESS IN 3 YEARS. This one comes from Strategic Coach founder Dan Sullivan. His thinking is that doubling or tripling your business can often be achieved by increasing effort or efficiency within the same business model, but those tools won’t get you to ten times. Where 2X-ing your business is analogous to moving house in the same city, says Sullivan—you can take everything with you—10X-ing is analogous to moving to the other side of the world—you have to leave most things behind. You will likely have to abandon your business model for a different one.

You have to 10X your success (revenue, profit or other meaningful measure) in three years? How do you do it? What does the new firm look like?
