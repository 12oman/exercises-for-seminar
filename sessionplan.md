# WIN!! (without pitching, without employees, without products, without services)

## Why pitch?
As part of your upcoming assignments you are expected to produce a report which includes a series of tasks designed to help you with pitching ideas in a way that is more likely to win you support for your ideas and ultimately bring you success. The skills gained could be helpful in the context of a job interview, a pitch to a client, or a pitch of a business case to your boss, or even a pitch to your family to get them to support your idea.

## Why not pitch?

At the same time, pitching inherently puts you into a situation where you are trying to convince someone of something. This requires you to give away your ideas to a certain degree. You are in the business of selling your ideas, so you must be careful. As your ideas are valuable, you are trying to gain support for your position _as an expert_ or technologist without undermining it. As you progress, it will become important to understand how to win without certain resources.

Imagine for example you have spent many years developing a keen sense of style as an interior decorator. You have worked to produce a solution to the client. However, if you are not careful, the "options" that you present to the client could be "rejected", and then simply bought directly from the store without your involvement.

I have a few ideas about how to do this, but today is not about me. I want to hear from you as you explore this session together. What are some ways that you have won without a given resource? It could be an example from your daily life. What are some ways that you have seen others win without undermining their expertise? What are some ways that you have seen others lose while seemingly pitching in a flawless way from a position of strength?

## The strength of criticality

Todays session is about using your imagination to apply some positive pressure onto your solutions to develop criticality.

The single most important thing that you can do is to develop your criticality. Criticality could be said to be the ability to see the flaws in your own ideas and to see the flaws in the ideas of others. 

The most common reason for a failed proposal, unsuccessful pitch or lost contract is a lack of criticality in the solution.

If you can develop a strong sense of flexibility to how you define your problem, and a strong sense of criticality to how you develop and present your solution, you will be able to win without whatever your chosen safety net.


# scenarios

For today, each of these scenarios can be applied to your own current research or work placements. 

If you are not currently working on a project, (you should develop this quickly!) you can use these [problem-spaces](problemspaces.md) for inspiration.
